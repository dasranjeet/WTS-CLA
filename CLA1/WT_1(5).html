        At the start of the war in 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, and Russian-backed separatists seized part of the south-eastern Donbas region of Ukraine, sparking a regional war there.[22][23] In 2021, Russia began a large military build-up along its border with Ukraine, amassing up to 190,000 troops along with their equipment. In a televised address shortly before the invasion, Russian president Vladimir Putin espoused irredentist views,[24] questioned Ukraine's right to statehood,[25][26] and falsely[27] accused Ukraine of being governed by neo-Nazis who persecute the ethnic Russian minority.[28] Putin also said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) constitutes a threat to Russia's national security by expanding eastward since the early 2000s, which NATO disputed.[29] Russia demanded NATO cease expansion and bar Ukraine from ever joining the alliance permanently.[30] The United States and others accused Russia of planning to attack or invade Ukraine, which Russian officials repeatedly denied as late as 23 February 2022.
